# Telecommunications Data Prediction and Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves predictions and analysis on telecommunications data gathered by professionals from the biggest companies in the world. The main goal is to analyze this data and create machine learning models that can predict various aspects of interest within the telecommunications domain.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Telecommunications data collected from industry professionals.
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of the data to derive meaningful insights.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Development and training of machine learning models to predict key aspects in telecommunications.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Liloiscracked/Predicting-Model-.git
    cd Nokia-DB
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the necessary environment variables.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation and analysis**:
    - Place your data files in the analysis files' .
    - Update the data paths in the configuration files if necessary.

2. **Model Training**:


3. **Model Prediction**:
